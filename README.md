# V5-Sim-Engine

This project is now archived. If you are looking for a related project,look [here](https://github.com/vexide/vex-v5-sim).

Welcome to the Lemlib VEX V5 Simulator! This open-source project aims to accurately simulate the full functionality of the V5 brain and PROS kernel.

This repository includes the graphical & physics simulation components to the simulator. 

Check out [the base layer](https://github.com/LemLib/pros-sim/) for all user-facing parts of the code as well as our custom build of the PROS Kernel.

## Features

- Will automatically find a correctly-built, correctly-named user programs in the same directory
- (planned) full drivetrain physics simulation
- (planned) means for users to provide device configuration and robot dimensions + attributes
- (planned) field & robot position visualization + device status display menu
- (potential) USB controller support for driver control

### Not Planned Currently:
- VEX IQ simulation
- VEXCode support
- Support for importing robot models
- Interactions with field elements
- Vision, optical sensor simulation (range finders / distance sensors are a maybe)
- Behavior of most mechanisms besides drivetrain
- Support for holonomic drives (will likely happen eventually, just not soon)
